          <h2>So what is bodybuilding?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p><b>Bodybuilding</b> Is the utilization of dynamic resistance exercise to control and build up one's muscle. If you happen to participate in this action, you sir are alluded as a bodybuilder. Now, you may think it's as simple as lifting weights and consuming high amounts of <b>protein</b>, but there's a lot more to it than you think...</p>
          <p>bodybuilding takes hard work, dedication and consistency. you need the knowledge on the types of training and the <a href="#techniques"><b>techniques</b></a> such as <a href="#progressive-overload"><b>progressive overload</b></a> and <a href="#hypertrophy"><b>hypertrophy</b></a> to incorporate in your workouts. moreover, you also need to know about <a href="#nutrition"><b>nutrition</b></a> that's best for you and <a href="goal.html"><b>your goal</b></a>. you can get it all at <b>lift</b>.</p>

            <h2>types of training</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class="container">
              <h3><b>></b> weight training</h3>
              <hr class="subhr">
              <p>weight training serves the primary purpose of developing the strength and size of your muscle through utilizing the weight against gravity. you know the soreness that becomes apparent a day or two after a workout? well that's partly due to the micro-tears inflicted on the muscles trained when weight training and the repair of these micro-tears is what causes muscle growth.</p>
              <p>Weight training prompts two different types of <a href="#hypertrophy"><b>hypertrophy</b></a> in order to build muscle and strength. sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar hypertrophy. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy composes larger muscles and is more favored by bodybuilders as opposed to myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight. In either case, there is an increase in both size and strength of the muscles.you can also cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from maintaining a <a href="#progressive-overload"><b>progressive overload</b></a>.</p>
              <h3><b>></b> strength training</h3>
              <hr class="subhr">
              <p>strength training is quite similar to weight training. however, evidently, this type of training is more focused towards building strength as well as endurance. strength training can provide significant functional benefits when performed correctly. these improvements consist of increased bone; muscle; tendon; and ligament strength, as well as increased bone density and metabolism. that's just the half of it... Strength training is typically associated with the production of lactate, otherwise known as lactic acid, which is a limiting factor of exercise performance that also causes muscle fatigue. Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training.</p>

              <div class="container">
                <span class="anchor" id="hypertrophy"></span>
                <h3><b>></b> hypertrophy</h3>
                <hr class="subhr">
                <p>hypertrophy involves an increase in size of the targeted muscle through a growth in size of its component cells. Two factors contribute to hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, which focuses more on increased muscle glycogen storage; and myofibrillar hypertrophy, which focuses more on developing size.</p>
                <p>Muscle grows when it is under stress. This is known as adaption. In order to benefit from this stress you must keep the muscle under a constant state of hypertrophy. The enlargement of a muscle fiber is called hypertrophy and  as i've mentioned, hypertrophy is a result of adaption to a new stress placed upon the muscle. So, what is the best form of stress? Well, there really is no single best principle that will work for every person. however, If you train using appropriate methods based on your individual body type, whether you're a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7rdnbux"><b>ectomorph</b></a>; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ydxc8mss"><b>mesomorph</b></a>; or <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7hdfab6"><b>endomorph</b></a>, you will ultimately get faster results.</p>
                <span class="anchor" id="progressive-overload"></span>
                <h3><b>></b> progressive overload</h3>
                <hr class="subhr">
                <p>progressive overload, is where the muscles are overloaded by attempting to lift as much weight as possible. the muscles then respond by growing larger and stronger. as a result, allowing you to repeat the technique, progressively, with heavier weights as you gain strength and endurance. however, this technique isn't recommended for those who are inexperienced because it is particularly risky lifting heavy weights if the correct form is not incorporated.</p>
                <h3><b>></b> split training</h3>
                <hr class="subhr">
                <p>split training involves working no more than three muscle groups per day, as opposed to spreading the training of a single muscle group throughout a training cycle of several days. split training involves fully exhausting individual muscle groups during a workout, then allowing several days for the muscle fibers to repair and fully recover. Muscles are worked roughly twice per week and allowed roughly 72 hours to recover. <a href="#recovery"><b>recovery</b></a> of certain muscle groups is usually achieved on days while training other groups.</p>

            <div>
              <h2>nutrition</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>bodybuilders require a specialized diet in order for the muscles to grow and recover. The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on <a href="goal.html"><b>your goal</b></a>. essentially, bodybuilders require more calories than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass.</p>
              <div class="container">
                <h3><b>></b> protein</h3>
                <hr class="subhr">
                <p>protein is an absolute essential in bodybuilding for this is the key to gains! Current advice suggests that bodybuilders should consume 25–30% of protein per total calorie intake to further their goal of maintaining and improving their body composition. This topic is widely debated, with many arguing that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day is ideal, although some suggest that less is sufficient, while others recommend 1.5, 2, or more. nevertheless protein needs to be consumed frequently throughout the day, especially during/after a workout to ensure you meet <a href="goal.html"><b>your goal</b></a> effectively.</p>
                <h3><b>></b> carbohydrates</h3>
                <hr class="subhr">
                <p>carbohydrates play an important role for bodybuilders. they give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. carbohydrates also promote insulin, a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need. Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis which is imperative if your goal is to increase muscle mass.</p>
                <h3><b>></b> supplements</h3>
                <hr class="subhr">
                <p>Both long-time bodybuilders and gym-newcomers need to pay close attention to their nutritional intake, so it's no surprise that supplements are incredibly popular among the bodybuilding crowd. as you know, nutrients are vital in bodybuilding and supplements are quick and simple to consume the major and micro nutrients you need to achieve your goal. Various supplements are used in an attempt to augment muscle size, increase fat loss rates and enhance training performance. protein, carbohydrates and fats are the three major nutrients that you need in order for muscle building.</p>

            <div>
              <h2>overtraining</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>overtraining occurs when a bodybuilder has trained to the point where his workload exceeds his recovery capacity. There are many reasons that overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long. if you think the longer you train the better your gains will be, then you are completely wrong. if your training for as long as, for instance, 3 hours, depending on the intensity, you could stimulate the central nervous system and can result in a hyper-adrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns. on the whole, training for prolonged periods isn't beneficial at all and can result in injuries.</p>
            </div>
            <span class="anchor" id="recovery"></span>
            <div style="margin-bottom:40px">
              <h2>rest</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>although muscle stimulation occurs during training, muscle growth occurs afterward during rest. without adequate rest and sleep (6 to 8 hours), muscles do not have an opportunity to recover and grow. about eight hours of sleep a night is desirable for the bodybuilder to be refreshed, although this varies from person to person. resting during the daytime to get a few more additional hours has been seen to be beneficial for some and massages are also known to be great for muscle recovery too.</p>
